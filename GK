Mach =  speed of sound (~1235km/h sea level)
mach (2.8 - 3.0) - about 3 times faster than sound 
mach(0.8) -  less than sound(~980km/hr)

-- reaction time for enemy(Brhmos- used in op sindoor vs tomhawk used in 90s)
BRAHMOS(INDIA+ RUSSIA jointly madde) =  air defence systems get only 20-30 sec to detect and intercept brahmos
for tomhawk (slow) , defences had minutes to react

so need to learn what and how does embedded systems help there! -  legit asap
