UAV Systems in Aerospace & Defense

âž¤ A Device-Centric and Embedded Systems Perspective

What is a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)?
A UAV (commonly called a drone) is an aerial vehicle that operates without a human pilot onboard, and is either remotely controlled or autonomously navigated using onboard embedded systems.
In aerospace and defense, UAVs are designed for specialized missions such as:

Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) - capturing real time visual or signal intelligence over enemy or sensitive areas without detection

Target acquisition and tracking - Identifying, locking and continuously following a target for strike or intelligence

Electronic Warfare (EW) - Disruptiong, jamming or deceiving enemy communication or  radar communication using onboarded emitters

Precision strike (combat) - fighting between the armed forces

Loitering munition attacks

Swarm coordination

Communication relay

Search and rescue

Payload delivery (logistics)
